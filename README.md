# HM-10 BLE Remote Control for XBMC/KODI

![Prototypes](Prototype/Header.jpg?raw=true)

My infrared remote control annoyed me because it was unreliable and I always wanted to do something with those 7$ Bluetooth Low Energy modules (HM-10) I had lying around. So I prototyped this BLE remote control which communicates with a NodeJS endpoint. This endpoint then relays the commands to XBMC/Kodi using the JSON-RPC API. This is not a complete guide but more a help or inspiration for others tinkering with the HM-10.

## Parts

* Arduino Pro Micro (5V)
* HM-10 BLE module incl. breakout with logic level shifter (so you can safely use 5V on RX/TX)
* KY-040 rotary encoder
* 1x LED and 220 Ohm resistor
* 2x switches
* some 10k resistors and 1uF ceramic capacitors
* wire
* a 5V power source

## Prerequisites

Setup your BLE Module by connecting to it with a USB to serial and enter the following commands:

```
AT+IMME0
AT+TYPE1
AT+ROLE1
AT+MODE2
```

## Wiring

Check the pictures in the `Circuit` folder.

## NodeJS Endpoint

For the NodeJS endpoint to work you need Mac OS or Linux with a BLE module (integrated / USB / ...). Also enter XBMC/Kodi settings and make sure that under`Remote`, controling XBMC/Kodi from remote is allowed. In your `advancedSettings.xml` should be this:

```
<jsonrpc>
    <compactoutput>false</compactoutput>
    <tcpport>9090</tcpport>
</jsonrpc>
```

Install Bluez if you use linux!

Use `npm install` to install the node script dependecies!

Adapt `linux.js` or `mac.js` to your needs. Use `node discover.js` to find your BLE module and get it's UUID. The service and characteristic vars should not be changed.

**Note on linux:** I had some problems on linux. It did not reliably discover my BLE module. I don't no it's because of Bluez or my BLE USB dongle. That's why I later used my Mac to run the NodeJS endpoint. The `mac.js` script will automatically start and enable caffeine. It will also play a sound when the remote connected to it. After exiting the `mac.js` script caffeine will be instructed to terminat.

## Remote features

* Sleep mode after 30 seconds (4mA low power mode)
* On/Off switch (because 4mA is still to much)
* 2 modes: Volume control / Menu control

**Volume control mode:** Turn the rotary encoder to change volume. Push the rotary encoder button to play/pause the movie.

**Menu control:** Turn the rotary encoder to move up or down the movie/series list. Press to enter/select, press long to go back.

Check out the arduino source code to get an idea of what the status LED does.
